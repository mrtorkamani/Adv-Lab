abstract = {We have compiled a new and complete catalog of the main properties of the 1509 pulsars for which published information currently exists. The catalog includes all spin-powered pulsars, as well as anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft gamma-ray repeaters showing coherent pulsed emission, but excludes accretion-powered systems. References are given for all data listed. We have also developed a new World Wide Web interface for accessing and displaying either tabular or plotted data with the option of selecting pulsars to be displayed via logical conditions on parameter expressions. The Web interface has an "expert" mode giving access to a wider range of parameters and allowing the use of custom databases. For users with locally installed software and database on Unix or Linux systems, the catalog may be accessed from a command-line interface. C-language functions to access specified parameters are also available. The catalog is updated from time to time to include new information.}
